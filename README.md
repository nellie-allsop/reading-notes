Hello! My name is Nellie (she/her) and this is my [GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/nellie-allsop). Something fun about me is that I like crochet, and it turns out that [it's not too disimilar to coding](https://webscapegardener.co.uk/why-coding-like-crochet/)!

## What is a "growth mindset"
Your mindset equates to what you think about yourself. And a growth mindset is a great mindset to have! When you have a growth mindset, you are open to learning. Someone with a growth mindset would likely:
- Prepare themself for learning
- Make connections between topics
- Have the approach that they can do something, even if they can't at the moment
- Would not think about their ability as being fixed
- Be inspired by the success of other people

ðŸŒŸHow can I keep myself in a growth mindset?ðŸŒŸ

1. Take an optimistic approach to issues that arise (they could be an opportunity to learn something new)
2. Read over my notes from the day when at home
3. Not let my past academic record define my abilities in this course

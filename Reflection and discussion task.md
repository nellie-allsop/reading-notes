Reflection and Discussion

The task: create a page in my reading-notes repo that summarizes the topics I have learned as though I was presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

The below is based on the following:
- [Getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)(specifically the sections on 'What is Markdown' and 'Why use Markdown')
- [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

Answers:

**1. What is Markdown?**

   Markdown is a type of coding language that allows you to manipulate text so that it appears a certain way when it is rendered.

**2. Why do we use Markdown?**

   We use markdown for many reasons: it can be transferred about easily, you can use it to create lots of things and it allows you to store important information without worrying that the application you've used to create it ceases to work.

**3. What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?**

   The hashtag /(#/)
   
    -**How many do you need to create the largest heading?** 

      You only need one to create the largest heading
   
    -**How many do you need to create the smallest heading?**

      You would need six to create the smallest heading
   
**4. When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?**
It is best pratice to use an asterisk /(*/)
   
**5. How do you create a link with Markdown?**

To create a link with Markdown, you place the words that you want to carry the link in square brackets, then (without leaving a space) you add the URL contained within parentheses

**6. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?**

The three symbols you can use to create an unordered list are the dash, the plus sign and the asterisk

   Now, lets translate the above into a blog post for a non-technical friend interested in learning about the area...

# So you want to learn about Markdown, eh?

Well, you've come to the right place. Markdown is a type of coding language that allows you to manipulate text so that it appears a certain way when it is rendered. You might ask, "Well why can't we just use Microsoft Word for that"? It's true, MS Word can be useful for manipulating text, but Markdown has some clear benefits over it:

- Markdown can be transferred about easily, so no worrying about whether you can open a document containing some all important information on your phone or not
- You can use it to create all sorts of wonderful things, from presentations to websites
- It allows you to store important information without worrying that the application you've used to create it ceases to work.

# So you want to learn about Markdown, eh?

Well, you've come to the right place. Markdown is a type of coding language that allows you to manipulate text so that it appears a certain way when it is rendered. You might ask, *"Well why can't we just use Microsoft Word for that"?* It's true, MS Word can be useful for manipulating text, but Markdown has some clear benefits over it:

- Markdown can be transferred about easily, so that means no worrying about whether you can open a document containing some super important information on your phone or not
- You can use it to create all sorts of wonderful things, from presentations to websites
- It allows you to store important information without worrying that the application you've used to create it ceases to work.

Say you want to create a basic web page using Markdown. You could start off by creating a heading by using a `#`, a space and then the text you want included within that heading. To create the largest type of heading possible in Markdown, you'd use just one of those hash symbols, while six of them would give you the teeniest and smallest of headings.

Next, you might decide you want to make some of your text in the body of your page bold or italicized. To do that, I'd advise you to use one asterisk `*` on either side of the word(s) you want to italicise, and two asterisks on either side of the word(s) you want to be bold.

Ok, we've got that sorted. Now, you've decided you want to link to one of your favourite webpages so that all the world can know about it. To do that, you'd place the words that you want to carry the link in square brackets, then (without leaving a space) you'd add the URL contained within parentheses.

Finally, you think to yourself, *"You know what this page needs, a really swish bulleted list."* To add one, simply add a dash, plus sign or asterisk before each item that you want to appear in that list (although make sure not to mix these - choose one and stick to it throughout your list, please and thank you!)

That basic webpage might end up looking a little something like this in its Markdown form:

```

# Why I love bin day
###### (An ode to Norwich City Council)

Bin day is **fab**, because then all the rubbish is gone, and I can *really* relax. I often double check [which day is bin day](https://maps.norwich.gov.uk/mynorwich/index.html). You might want to check which day your bins are collected too, because then:

+ You won't be scared when you hear a large vehicle pulling up to your driveway in the early hours
+ You can tell all your friends about the interesting knowledge you've accumulated
+ You'll feel reassured that at least that part of your life is ordered and reliable.

```

When the above is rendered, you'd end up with the below:

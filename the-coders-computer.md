# Text editors and commands

It's an exciting time in your life - you want to settle down with a text editor, and you want it to be the perfect one, just for you. When it comes to choosing said text editor, there are some important features you should be looking for when you start your research process:

- A variety of themes on offer - for example, can you decide between a light and a dark background?
- Able to have extensions (so that your text editor can change with you on your coding journey)
- Syntax highlighting, which should prove super helpful when it comes to finding those pesky errors
- Code completion (because who doesn't love a helping hand!)

Next, let's have a think about your terminal on your computer (that one you set up the other week thanks to the great instructions from the Tech Educators team). If you type the following commands into your terminal, then these magical things will happen:

`pwd` = Print Working Directory - shows where you are at the moment  
`ls` = lists the contents of a directory  
`cd` = Change Directories - how you move to another directory  
`mkdir` = Make Directory - allows you to create a directory  
`touch` = how you make a blank file.  

In the following scenario, if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line in your terminal:

`cd projects`  
`mkdir new-project`  
`touch new-project/newfile.md`  
`cd ..`  
`ls projects/new-project`   

Then the following will happen

1. Change directories to the directory 'projects'
2. Make a directory called 'new-project'  
3. Make a blank file and call that 'newfile.md'
4. Change directories to .. (dots indicate some of the command's normal output has been cut)
5. List the contents of the directory 'projects/new-project'
